== README

The repository for the alphaBlog app made while following
the Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course

This project has taught me how a project is built and structured using Ruby
on Rails.

Concepts that I have learned:

* The Ruby on Rails CRUD operations
* Database and database migration 
* the MVC architecture in Ruby on Rails
* the route structure of a Ruby on Rails controller and view setup
* The association models of Ruby on Rails
* production and deployment using Heroku
* Restricting actions on the UI and controller side of things

Some features of the alphaBlog:

* Ability to create users, articles and assign to different categories
* Viewing different sections of the website
* Different actions associated with the type of user you are (visitor, user, admin)
